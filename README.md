## About Project

This project is aimed at creating a Bubble sorting algorithm which includes optimization to allow a faster run-time

## Get Started

1. Download the algorithm by cloning the repo to your computer ```git clone https://github.com/mrnadaara/Bubble-Sort.git```

2. Then pass any argument you wish to the 'bubble_sort' method ```bubble_sort([array])```

3. Alternatively you could use the 'bubble_sort_by' method for a more defined approach

4. Run the file in the terminal ```ruby bubble_sort.rb```
